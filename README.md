These are all the projects I created to practice programming in Python. 

Note: these projects are all exercises given during the courses Programming Fundamentals and Objected Oriented Programming while I studied Graduate Programming at Thomas More.
These exercises were originally created to practice coding in java, I used them to practice objected oriented programming in Python.
